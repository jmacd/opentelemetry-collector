# Phase 7: Plugin Architecture for Go and Rust Components

## Overview

Phase 7 introduces dynamic plugin support for Go and Rust components in the OpenTelemetry Collector. This enables runtime extensibilityâ€”loading new components without recompiling the main binary. The design ensures safety, compatibility, and hermeticity despite dynamic linking challenges.

## Design Goals

1. **Dynamic Extensibility**: Load Go and Rust components as plugins at runtime
2. **Hermetic Builds**: Guarantee plugins and main binary use identical dependencies, compiler versions, and build flags
3. **Version Safety**: Prevent runtime crashes from mismatched versions or ABIs
4. **Cross-Language Support**: Support plugins in both Go and Rust with idiomatic loading patterns
5. **Distribution Verification**: Verify plugin compatibility before loading via manifest and artifact checks

## Go Plugin System

- Uses Go's native plugin package with plugin build mode for shared libraries
- Plugins must use identical Go version, module versions, and build flags as the main binary
- The builder will:
  - Generate manifests describing Go version, module hashes, and build flags (JSON/YAML)
  - Embed manifests in both main binary and plugins
  - Verify manifests at runtime before loading plugins
- Plugins export a known registration symbol following standard naming conventions

**Caveats:**
- Go plugins only supported on Linux and macOS, not Windows
- All dependencies must be statically linked and version-matched

## Rust Plugin System

- Uses Cargo to build shared libraries as cdylib crates, loaded via dynamic linking
- Plugins must use identical Rust version, crate versions, and Cargo settings as the main binary
- The builder will:
  - Generate manifests with Rust version, crate hashes, and build flags (TOML/JSON)
  - Embed manifests in both main binary and plugins as sections or exported symbols
  - Verify manifests at runtime before loading plugins
- Plugins export C-compatible registration functions following standard FFI conventions

**Caveats:**

- Rust has no stable ABI; all FFI boundaries must use C-compatible types
- All dependencies must be version-matched and statically linked

## Hermetic Build & Distribution

The builder supports "hermetic" build mode:

- Uses Docker to encapsulate build environment (compiler versions, OS, etc.)
- Dockerfile is generated or versioned alongside the distribution
- All plugins and main binary built in the same container for identical environments
- Build process outputs:
  - Main Collector binary
  - Plugin shared libraries
  - Version manifests for each artifact
  - Dockerfile or build environment hash

At runtime, the Collector will:

- Refuse to load plugins with mismatched manifests
- Provide CLI commands to verify plugin compatibility and inspect metadata

## Unified Plugin Manifest Schema

Both Go and Rust plugins will embed a manifest with the following structure (JSON):

```json
{
  "language": "go", // or "rust"
  "toolchain_version": "1.22.3", // go version or rustc version
  "build_profile": "release",
  "dependency_hashes": {
    "otel-arrow": "b1c2d3...",
    "go.opentelemetry.io/collector": "a9b8c7..."
  },
  "build_flags": ["-buildmode=plugin"],
  "target": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
  "build_time": "2025-07-03T12:34:56Z"
}
```

- For Go: toolchain_version contains Go version output; dependency_hashes contains module hashes
- For Rust: toolchain_version contains Rust compiler version output; dependency_hashes contains crate hashes
- Manifest exported as named symbol for Rust plugins, embedded in Go binaries/plugins for extraction

## CLI Plugin Probing and Introspection

The Collector CLI provides commands for plugin inspection and validation:

- **List plugins**: Display all plugins in configured directory with manifest info (language, version, hashes)
- **Validate plugin**: Load specific plugin, extract manifest, check compatibility with main binary
- **Inspect plugin**: Print detailed manifest and exported symbols without loading into main process
- **Check all plugins**: Validate all plugins in directory, report mismatches or issues

These commands enable safe, transparent plugin management for automation.

## Component Introspection and Documentation

The Collector CLI supports commands for built-in and plugin components:

- **List components**: Display all components with types, modules, and stability levels
- **Explain component**: Show configuration schema and documentation for specific component type
- **Default configuration**: Print default configuration for component type
- **List plugin components**: Display only plugin components, filtering out built-in ones

This enables component discovery, understanding, and validation regardless of origin.


## Plugin Discovery & Registration

Plugins are discovered via configured directory or manifest file. On load, the Collector:

- Verifies the manifest
- Loads the shared library
- Calls exported registration function to register new factories/components


## Testing & Verification

Automated tests will:

- Build Collector and plugins in hermetic Docker environment
- Attempt loading plugins with mismatched manifests (should fail)
- Load and use plugins with matching manifests (should succeed)

Manual and CLI verification tools inspect plugin manifests, build environments, and component documentation.

## Next Steps

- Define manifest schema for Go and Rust plugins
- Implement manifest embedding and verification logic
- Extend builder to support Docker-based hermetic builds
- Implement plugin loading and registration logic in Collector
- Document plugin development and distribution workflow
