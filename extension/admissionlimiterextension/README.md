The admission limiter extension limits requests based on the amount of
memory that has been admitted into the pipeline, measured in MiB of
uncompressed data (`request_limit_mib`). A second quantity of memory
enables blocking requests, instead of immediately failing them, when
the limit is exceeded (`waiting_limit_mib`).

Components, typically receivers, are expected to opt-in to use of the
`limit.Extension` interface in `extension/xextension/limit` which
requires obtaining a client, estimating uncompressed request size,
acquiring the resource, and releasing when the request finishes.  See
the [limit extension interface](#../xextension/limit/README.md).
